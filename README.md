# 🛒 ShoppyGlobe – E-commerce Application

- Created a fully responsive **E-commerce application** using React.
- Built with **React | Redux Toolkit | Tailwind CSS | React Router**.
- Uses **Vite** for fast development and optimized builds.
- Version control implemented using **Git & GitHub**.

---

## About the Project –

1. **ShoppyGlobe** is a basic e-commerce application where users can browse products and manage their shopping cart.
2. The **Home page** displays a list of products fetched from an external API.
3. Users can **search products** using the search bar present in the header (powered by Redux state).
4. Clicking on a product navigates to the **Product Detail page**, showing detailed information.
5. Users can **add products to the cart**, **increase/decrease quantity**, or **remove products**.
6. The **Cart page** displays selected products with quantity controls and subtotal calculation.
7. The **Checkout page** includes a dummy form with validation and an order summary.
8. On successful checkout, an **“Order placed”** message is shown, the cart is cleared, and the user is redirected to the Home page.
9. **Redux Toolkit** is used for global state management (cart items & search).
10. **Lazy loading & code splitting** are implemented using `React.lazy` and `Suspense`.
11. A custom **404 NotFound page** handles invalid routes gracefully.
12. Fully responsive and optimized for **mobile, tablet, and desktop** devices.
